APT29 is a highly capable group of hackers, known for its long-running and persistent campaigns aimed at conducting espionage and data theft against a range of targets, including tech giants Microsoft and SolarWinds, as well as foreign governments.Google said it found the hidden exploit code embedded on Mongolian government websites between November 2023 and July 2024. During this time, anyone who visited these sites using an iPhone or Android device could have had their phone hacked and data stolen, including passwords, in what is known as a ‚Äúwatering hole‚Äù attack.The exploits took advantage of vulnerabilities in the iPhone‚Äôs Safari browser and Google Chrome on Android that had already been fixed at the time of the suspected Russian campaign. Still, those exploits nevertheless could be effective in compromising unpatched devices.According to the blog post, the exploit targeting iPhones and iPads was designed to steal user account cookies stored in Safari specifically across a range of online email providers that host the personal and work accounts of the Mongolian government. The attackers could use the stolen cookies to then access those government accounts. Google said the campaign aimed at targeting Android devices used two separate exploits together to steal user cookies stored in the Chrome browser.Google security researcher Clement Lecigne, who authored the blog post, told TechCrunch that it is not known for certain who the Russian government hackers were targeting in this campaign. ‚ÄúBut based on where the exploit was hosted and who would normally visit these sites, we believe that Mongolian government employees were a likely target,‚Äù he said.Lecigne, who works for Google‚Äôs Threat Analysis Group, the security research unit that investigates government-backed cyber threats, said Google is linking the reuse of the code to Russia because the researchers previously observed the same cookie-stealing code used by APT29 during an earlier campaign in 2021.A key question remains: How did the Russian government hackers obtain the exploit code to begin with? Google said both iterations of the watering hole campaign targeting the Mongolian government used code resembling or matching exploits from Intellexa and NSO Group. These two companies are known for developing exploits capable of delivering spyware that can compromise fully patched iPhones and Android phones.Google said the exploit code used in the watering hole attack targeting Chrome users on Android shared a ‚Äúvery similar trigger‚Äù with an exploit developed earlier by NSO Group. In the case of the exploit targeting iPhones and iPads, Google said the code used the ‚Äúexact same trigger as the exploit used by Intellexa,‚Äù which Google said strongly suggested that the exploit authors or providers ‚Äúare the same.‚ÄùWhen asked by TechCrunch about the reuse of exploit code, Lecigne said: ‚ÄúWe do not believe the actor recreated the exploit,‚Äù ruling out the likelihood that the exploit was independently discovered by the Russian hackers.¬†‚ÄúThere are multiple possibilities as to how they could have acquired the same exploit, including purchasing it after it was patched or stealing a copy of the exploit from another customer,‚Äù said Lecigne.NSO Group did not respond to TechCrunch‚Äôs inquiry prior to publication. In a statement provided after publication, NSO spokesperson Gil Lainer said: ‚ÄúNSO does not sell its products to Russia. Our technologies are sold exclusively to vetted U.S. & Israel-allied intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Our systems and technologies are highly secure and are continuously monitored to detect and neutralize external threats.‚ÄùTechCrunch contacted the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC and Mongolia‚Äôs Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York for comment, but did not hear back by press time. Intellexa could not be reached for comment. Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer did not respond to a request for comment.Google said users should ‚Äúapply patches quickly‚Äù and keep software up-to-date to help prevent malicious cyberattacks. According to Lecigne, iPhone and iPad users with the high-security feature Lockdown Mode switched on were not affected even when running a vulnerable software version.Updated with post-publish response from NSO.Topics\n\t\tSecurity Editor\n\t\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

        "Here is what I found:\n\nA massive sinkhole has appeared in the heart of Bangkok, Thailand, raising concerns about the stability of nearby construction projects. The sinkhole, which is approximately 10 meters deep and 30 meters wide, opened up in front of a shopping mall under construction. The incident has prompted authorities to halt construction work in the area and investigate the cause of the sinkhole.\n\nExperts believe that the sinkhole was caused by the excavation of the construction site, which may have destabilized the ground beneath the mall. The incident has highlighted the need for stricter regulations and oversight of construction projects in Bangkok, which is prone to flooding and subsidence due to its location on the Chao Phraya River delta.\n\nThe appearance of the sinkhole has also raised concerns about the safety of other construction projects in the city, particularly those located in areas with weak soil or high groundwater levels. Authorities are now conducting a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the sinkhole and assess the impact on nearby structures.\n\nIn the meantime, construction work in the area has been halted, and authorities are working to stabilize the ground and prevent further subsidence. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of proper planning and oversight in construction projects, particularly in areas with challenging geological conditions."

        "The video appears to focus on a significant incident at a construction site in Bangkok, Thailand, which has resulted in a large sinkhole. Here is a summary of the key events and discussions captured in the video:\n\n1. **Construction Site Incident**: The video begins by showing a construction site with a large hole in the ground, surrounded by various construction materials and equipment, indicating an ongoing or recent construction incident.\n\n2. **Press Conference on Police Station Security**: At 0:65, Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt addresses the media at a press conference. He discusses the issue of police station security, which is a current concern, suggesting that the incident may be related to or impacting nearby infrastructure.\n\n3. **Site Examination by Engineers/Workers**: At 130.5 seconds, a group of people, possibly engineers or construction workers, are seen examining the site of the incident. They are discussing the cause of the collapse and the structural integrity of the building, indicating an ongoing investigation and assessment of the damage.\n\n4. **Large Sinkhole Inspection**: At 195.8 seconds, the video shows a large sinkhole in Bangkok, with construction workers inspecting the damage. This reinforces the severity of the incident and the efforts to understand and address it.\n\n5. **Prime Minister's Address**: At 0:04:21, the Prime Minister of Thailand is seen speaking to the press. He is surrounded by media reporters, and other officials are standing behind him. The background appears to be a construction site with green tarps and helmets visible, suggesting that the incident is of significant public and governmental concern.\n\nOverall, the video highlights the response to a significant construction-related incident in Bangkok, involving high-level officials and on-site inspections, and emphasizes the importance of addressing both the immediate damage and broader security concerns."
